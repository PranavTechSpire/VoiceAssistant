# VoiceAssistant
An AI-powered desktop voice assistant with GUI that enables natural voice/text interaction, facial recognition login, and automation of tasks like WhatsApp messaging, YouTube control, and mobile commands via ADB. It uses Hugging Face LLaMA for responses and Picovoice for hotword detection, offering seamless, secure, and efficient use.
1.1 Motivation
In today’s fast-paced digital world, human-computer interaction is evolving from traditional interfaces like keyboard and mouse to more intuitive and natural methods. Voice assistants are at the forefront of this change, offering hands-free operation, improved accessibility, and enhanced productivity. With advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, the integration of smart assistants into daily computing is no longer a luxury but a necessity. The motivation behind this project is to create an intelligent, personalized voice assistant that leverages modern technologies to perform tasks efficiently and interact naturally with users. By combining voice recognition, automation, and user-friendly design, the goal is to make digital interactions more seamless and accessible.

1.2 Problem Statement
Traditional desktop environments require continuous manual interaction, which can be inefficient, especially for routine or repetitive tasks. Existing voice assistants, although widely available, often lack deep customization, robust system-level integration, or the ability to automate complex workflows on desktop systems. They are typically limited to mobile platforms or smart speakers and do not cater to users who need comprehensive automation on their computers. Furthermore, many solutions lack secure authentication features, making them unsuitable for handling sensitive tasks. Hence, there is a need for a secure, intelligent desktop assistant capable of understanding natural language, executing real-time actions across both web and local systems, and providing voice and GUI-based interaction.

1.3 Objectives
The project titled "Intelligent Personal Voice Assistant with GUI and Automation Features" aims to develop a smart assistant that addresses the above challenges. The main objectives include:

Enabling interaction through both voice and text.

Integrating Hugging Face’s LLaMA for AI-driven, context-aware responses.

Implementing hotword detection using Picovoice API for hands-free activation.

Ensuring secure login using facial recognition via OpenCV and the LBPH algorithm.

Automating tasks such as WhatsApp Web messaging, YouTube search and playback, and mobile operations using ADB commands.

Creating a responsive GUI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through the Eel framework to provide an intuitive user interface.

This assistant aims to improve daily desktop usage through intelligence, security, and seamless automation.
